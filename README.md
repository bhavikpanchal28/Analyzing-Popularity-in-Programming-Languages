# Analyzing-Popularity-in-Programming-Languages

In this project, I analyzed the popularity of various programming languages throughout the years. \
I eventually ended up choosing 5 programming languages to work with because they seemed to be a few of the most relevant programming languages today.\
The data was received from a Kaggle dataset analyzing the use of programming languages since 2004. \
These programming languages are :
- C
- Java
- Javascript
- PHP
- Python

I then used an ARIMA model to predict the trend of the popularity for each of these programming languages for the next 5 years. \
